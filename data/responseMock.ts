Here’s a basic recipe for pancakes using the ingredients you listed:\n\n### Simple Pancakes\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup of all-purpose flour (if you have it)\n- 2 tablespoons of sugar\n- 2 teaspoons of baking powder (if you have it)\n- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n- 1 cup of milk\n- 1 egg\n- 2 tablespoons of melted butter or sunflower oil\n- 1 tablespoon of olive oil (for cooking)\n\n#### Directions:\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n   - In another bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk and melted butter (or sunflower oil).\n   - Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; some lumps are okay.\n\n2. **Cook the Pancakes:**\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a little olive oil to coat the pan.\n   - Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet.\n   - Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.\n   - Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.\n\n3. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the pancakes warm with your choice of toppings like syrup, fruit, or butter.\n\nIf you don’t have flour or baking powder, you could make scrambled eggs instead:\n\n### Simple Scrambled Eggs\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 4 eggs\n- 1/4 cup of milk\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 tablespoon of butter or sunflower oil\n- 1 tablespoon of olive oil (for cooking)\n\n#### Directions:\n1. **Prepare the Eggs:**\n   - In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together until well blended.\n\n2. **Cook the Eggs:**\n   - Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add butter or sunflower oil to the skillet and let it melt.\n   - Pour in the egg mixture.\n   - Stir occasionally with a spatula, lifting and folding the eggs as they cook.\n   - Cook until the eggs are thickened and no liquid egg remains, but they are not dry.\n\n3. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the scrambled eggs warm, possibly with a sprinkle of pepper.\n\nBoth options are delicious and make good use of your available ingredients. Enjoy your cooking!"
