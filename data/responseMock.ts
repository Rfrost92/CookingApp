Here's a basic recipe:\n\n### Simple Omelette\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 tablespoon milk\n- Salt, to taste\n- Pepper, to taste\n- 1 tablespoon butter or olive oil (for cooking)\n\n#### Optional:\n- A pinch of sugar (for a hint of sweetness)\n- Olive oil and sunflower oil, if you want to mix oils for cooking\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. **Beat the Eggs**: In a bowl, crack the eggs. Add the milk, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of pepper. If you like, add a tiny pinch of sugar to balance the flavors. Beat the eggs and other ingredients together until well combined.\n\n2. **Heat the Pan**: Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter (or olive oil, or a mix of olive and sunflower oil) to the pan. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the skillet evenly.\n\n3. **Cook the Omelette**: Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let it cook undisturbed for a minute or two until the edges start to set. With a spatula, gently lift the edges and tilt the pan to allow uncooked egg to flow to the edges.\n\n4. **Fold and Finish**: Once the omelette is mostly set, you can fold it in half. Let it cook for another 30 seconds to a minute, until fully set but still tender.\n\n5. **Serve**: Slide the omelette onto a plate. Garnish with additional salt and pepper if desired.\n\nEnjoy your simple homemade omelette! You can also experiment by adding other ingredients such as cheese, herbs, or vegetables if you have them on hand."
